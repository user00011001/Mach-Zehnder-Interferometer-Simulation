# Quantum Interference Simulation

This Python script simulates quantum interference using the Strawberry Fields library. It allows users to explore the effects of different phase settings and displacement amplitudes on the photon number distribution in a two-mode quantum system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Strawberry Fields library

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the Strawberry Fields library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install strawberryfields
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python quantum_interference.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the phase settings and displacement amplitudes for each mode:
   - Choose the phase setting for mode 0 from the provided options (in radians).
   - Choose the phase setting for mode 1 from the provided options (in radians).
   - Choose the displacement amplitude for mode 0 from the provided options.
   - Choose the displacement amplitude for mode 1 from the provided options.

5. The script will run the quantum interference simulation using the selected parameters and display the measurement results.

6. The measurement results show the photon number distribution for each mode after the simulation, indicating the number of shots where specific numbers of photons were measured.


- The photon number distribution results provide insights into the quantum interference effects based on the chosen phase settings and displacement amplitudes.
