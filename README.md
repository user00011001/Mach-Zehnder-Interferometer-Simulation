Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Simulation
This Python program simulates a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with two input modes and two output modes using the Strawberry Fields library. The user can choose the phase settings for each mode and the initial state preparation.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Strawberry Fields library
Installation
Install Python 3.x 
Install the Strawberry Fields library using pip:

Copy code
pip install strawberryfields
Usage
Run the program:

Copy code
python mach_zehnder_interferometer.py
Follow the prompts to choose the phase settings for each mode and the initial state preparation.
The program will run the simulation and display the most probable photon number for each output mode.
Simulation Details
The Mach-Zehnder interferometer consists of the following components:

Two input modes (Mode 0 and Mode 1)
Two beam splitters (50/50)
Two phase shifters (configurable phase settings)
Two output modes (Mode 0 and Mode 1)
